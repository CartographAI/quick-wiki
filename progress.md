# Cartograph Development Progress

## Current Status (May 7, 2024)

The first version of Cartograph is now operational. The full documentation generation pipeline is working, including repository scanning, LLM-powered analysis, and markdown document creation with diagrams.

### What Works

- **Core Functionality**: The end-to-end documentation generation pipeline is functional
- **Repository Scanning**: Correctly analyzes repository structure using the `tree` command
- **File Analysis**: Selects and reads relevant files for documentation
- **LLM Integration**: Successfully communicates with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- **Documentation Generation**: Creates well-structured markdown files with:
  - Mermaid diagrams for architecture visualization
  - Code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
  - Well-organized sections and hierarchy
  - Table of contents via index.md

### Components Implemented

1. **Repository Scanner**: Analyzes repository structure and reads file contents
2. **Gemini Service**: Handles communication with Google's Gemini API
   - Uses structured outputs for reliable data parsing
   - Includes robust error handling for API interactions
3. **Documentation Generator**: Creates and writes markdown documentation files
4. **Orchestrator**: Coordinates the entire documentation process

### Command-Line Interface

The CLI has been implemented with the following capabilities:

- Accepting a repository path as input
- Optional specification of an output directory
- Optional specification of the Gemini API key (otherwise reads from .env)
- Test commands for development and verification

### Development Environment

- TypeScript project structure with proper configuration
- Jest testing framework set up
- npm scripts for building and running
- Verification script to check environment setup

### Example Output

The system successfully generates documentation that includes:

- Project overview pages
- Architecture diagrams using Mermaid
- Component details with code snippets
- Installation and setup instructions
- Data flow visualizations
- Error handling explanations

## Areas for Improvement

While the basic system is functional, several areas could be enhanced:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: The prompts sent to Gemini could be further refined to produce more accurate and comprehensive documentation

   - Current prompts work but may produce inconsistent formatting
   - Further experimentation with instruction clarity could yield better results

2. **Error Handling**: Additional robustness for file reading and API errors

   - Currently handles basic errors, but could be more comprehensive
   - Exponential backoff for API rate limiting not fully implemented

3. **Testing**: More comprehensive test coverage

   - Unit tests for all components (currently only Repository Scanner)
   - Integration tests for the full pipeline

4. **Performance Optimization**:

   - File reading could be more efficient for large repositories
   - Parallel processing of documentation generation
   - Caching mechanisms to prevent redundant API calls

5. **Documentation Customization**:
   - Support for templates
   - Configuration options for documentation style and format
   - Options to exclude certain files or directories
